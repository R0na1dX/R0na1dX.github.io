Hi Everyone! My name is Ronald Xie. I was born and raised in China, and I moved to Hawaii when I was 14. I decided to major in MIS because I believe that the future is technology so it is important to have sufficient understanding in this field to become an in-demand job candidate. I look forward to working with you guys on this journey.
